# Censored data

These are where the precise measurement of a time point is not complete. 

To illustrate, we'll use data from a [Sliced competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sliced-s01e10-playoffs-2/) on adoptions of shelter animals. 

The data set is for > 24K dogs and includes predictors based on breed (34), color (15), sex, and other characteristics. 

The `age` of the dogs is the outcome with an event indicator called `adopted`. 

---
# Types of censoring

* _right censored_: Sadie was born on 2020-01-01 and was not yet adopted as of 2021-11-03.

* _left censored_: We don't know when Sadie was born but she was alive as of 2020-05-01 and was adopted on 2021-11-03. 

* _interval censoring_: We don't know when Sadie was born but she was alive as of 2020-05-01 and was not yet adopted as of 2021-11-03.

There are many other aspects of these data, such as multiple event times, correlated event times, and/or competing risks.

# The censored package

This package, currently on GitHub, adds engines for the `parsnip` package so that we can fit various types of event time models. 

The goals for the package are: 

* Provide a clean, consistent user interface and object types. 

* Enable additional "guard rails" for these particular models (e.g. empirical validation, eliminate information leakage, etc.). 

* Allow users access to additional models and techniques. 

To install:

```r
require("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tidymodels/censored")
```

```{r ph-prob-calc-1, eval = FALSE}

tidymodels always generates _one row of predictions_ for each row of the input data set.

# A regularized model with strata

`glmnet` has an option for fitting Cox models but...

 * matrices are required (i.e. no formulas)
 * strata as specified as part of the _outcome_ in its own special syntax and function (`stratifySurv()`). 

We allow the standard formula interface for this model and you can use the usual  `strata()` function:  

```{r glmnet}
cph_glmnet_strata_fit <-
  proportional_hazards(penalty = 0.1, mixture = 0.75) %>%
  set_engine("glmnet") %>%
  fit(Surv(age, adopted) ~ . + strata(sex), data = dogs)
```

Prediction code looks the same. 

---
# A bagged tree

The nice thing about `parsnip` models is that the model syntax is very similar from model-to-model. For example, if we use a bagged tree: 

.code80[

.pull-left-a-lot[

```{r tree-calc, eval = FALSE}
bag_fit <-
  bag_tree() %>%
  set_mode("censored regression") %>%
  set_engine("rpart", times = 50) %>%
  fit(Surv(age, adopted) ~ ., data = dogs)

predict(bag_fit, our_dogs, type = "survival", time = times) %>% 
  surv_curves()
```

]
.pull-right-a-little[

```{r tree, ref.label='tree-calc', echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center', dev = 'svg', dev.args = list(bg = "#F9F8F3ff"), fig.width=5, fig.height=5}

```
]

]

Other models: `boost_tree()`, `decision_tree()`, `rand_forest()`, and `survival_reg()`.

# Opionionated choices

* Linear predictors are always increasing with time. tidymodels assumes that you can compute performance without knowing about the model type or other data. 

* Many survival ROC methods are not designed for assessing predictions. We will implement the one that is most appropriate. 

* Current specifications for baseline survival groups are very limited. We'll give a more versatile tool for declaring the baseline. 



---
# What's next


* Time-dependent covariates
* Additional models/prediction methods
* Performance metrics (in the `yardstick` package)
* Model tuning (with the `tune` package)

# Thanks

Special thanks to Emil Hvitfeldt for creating the first version of censored.
